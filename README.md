## Hi there 👋

---

## 📌 **Developer To-Do List**  
Welcome to my developer journey! Here's what I'm currently working on and planning for the future.

---

### 🚀 **Current Projects**  
- [ ] Update JavaScript Ecommerce for readability  
- [ ] Figure out Stripe JS and Google Advertisements  
- [ ] Build an Electron.JS application to organize delivery biz related emails into a single scrollable page based on date.
  - [ ] Time jump to specific dates
  - [ ] All electronic communications and documents are organized by date and available within the application
  - [ ] Reason for building:  Gmail is not for me, as there are too many seperate strings of communication with nested data that is only available upon click.  I need just one large scrollable application that goes from the first communication to the last.
- [ ] Contribute to an **open-source** project
